<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Dealing with addresses of customers from your back end system is proving difficult. The system sends you the correct addresses
customers but filled with random whitepaces all over. Your challenge is to transfer those addresses without any leading 
or trailing whitepsaces making any multiple whitespaces in between singles.</p>
<h3>Use cases</h3>
<ul>
	<li>"5 london street" should be "5 london street"</li>
	<li>" 5 london street" should be "5 london street"</li>
	<li>"5 london street    " should be "5 london street"</li>
	<li>"5     london      street" should be "5 london street"</li>
	<li>"     5     london      street       " should be "5 london street"</li>
</ul>
